# Pull Request Coffee

Pull Request Coffee is a Canadian import and roasting venture rethinking how specialty coffee gets from farm to cup — with transparency, traceability, and Git-style collaboration.

We are technologists, logistics nerds, and coffee lovers building a full-stack coffee operation. We source ethically, track obsessively, and document everything in the open.

## Vision

We aim to become the most transparent coffee company in Canada — from origin to onboarding. Our phased rollout starts with:

1. **Ethical Imports for Indie Roasters**  
2. **Roaster-Ready Micro-Lots + Pilot Fulfillment**  
3. **In-House Roasting, B2C Subscriptions, and Brand Launch**

## This Repo

This repository serves as our operations HQ. Inside:

- Regulatory and customs prep  
- Market research and discovery  
- Price modeling and fulfillment setup  
- Automation tools for roadmap syncing and prompt-driven docs  
- Full business scaffolding (finance, HR, legal, investor)

## Current Focus

We are in Phase 1 — validating demand, testing suppliers, and preparing for a 2025 pilot import.

Target: First small-batch LCL shipment + B2B commitments by Day 90.
