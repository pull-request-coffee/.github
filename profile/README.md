# Pull Request Coffee

**Pull Request Coffee** is a Canadian coffee import and roasting company founded by technologists and operators who care deeply about transparent supply chains, ethical sourcing, and excellent coffee. We're building a vertically integrated, modern coffee venture that blends farm-level traceability with developer-style workflows and clean operational execution.

This repository serves as the central planning hub for the business — combining market research, regulatory setup, brand development, financial modeling, and roadmap tooling into a single, source-controlled workspace.

## Vision

We're building a full-stack coffee operation, beginning with import logistics and scaling toward finished products and direct customer relationships. The business model is designed to support:

- **Ethical Imports + Supplier Visibility**  
  Small-lot green coffee sourced from trusted origin partners with transparent pricing and certifications.

- **Roaster-Friendly Distribution**  
  Logistics and lot sizes designed for independent Canadian roasters — not just national chains.

- **Modern Tooling for an Old-School Industry**  
  Prompt-driven content systems, roadmap sync to GitHub, and traceable operations powered by open-source-style thinking.

- **Roasting, Branding, and Direct Sales (Phase 3)**  
  A full Canadian coffee brand offering roasted product SKUs via B2B and B2C channels.
