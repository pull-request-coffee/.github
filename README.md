# Pull Request Coffee

**Pull Request Coffee** is a Canadian specialty coffee import and roasting company built by technologists and operators who love clean logistics, transparent supply chains, and good beans.

We started as a lean import-first venture focused on supplying indie roasters and specialty cafés — but we're building toward a full-stack coffee brand: from farm-level traceability to roasted retail products and a community of subscription customers.

This repo serves as the operational and planning hub for the business — including market research, regulatory setup, supplier outreach, and roadmap tooling.

## 🧭 What We’re Building

- **Phase 1 – Validate**  
  - Talk to customers (roasters, cafes, retailers)  
  - Vet 3–5 suppliers and sample green coffee  
  - Lock in regulatory compliance & logistics partners  

- **Phase 2 – Import & Pilot**  
  - First small-batch import (LCL)  
  - Fulfill B2B orders, test pricing, refine ops  

- **Phase 3 – Expand & Roast**  
  - Scale imports, finalize in-house roasting strategy  
  - Launch B2C brand (subscription, direct)  
  - Begin packaging and warehouse optimization  

All phases are tracked and checklisted inside [`phase_checklist.md`](./phase_checklist.md) and synced to GitHub Issues.

## 📌 Current Focus (April 2025)

We are in **Phase 1: Validation & Setup**. Key tasks in progress:

- Conducting coffee shop discovery interviews ([questions here](./data/market-validation/discovery_questions.md))  
- Requesting quotes and samples from 3–5 origin suppliers  
- Drafting import compliance checklist (BN, CFIA, SFCR, labeling rules)  
- Building a lightweight brand story & visual direction  
- Preparing pricing model and gross margin calculator  

Target: First pilot shipment ordered and customer LOIs secured by **Day 90**.

## 📈 Business Model Highlights

- **Import-first, roast-second** → We unlock margin later by layering on value-add  
- **B2B & B2C split** → Wholesale to roasters/cafés, then direct-to-consumer roasting  
- **Hybrid finance model** → Private investment + operating line or commercial loan  
- **Shareholder perks** → Dividend model includes roasted coffee
